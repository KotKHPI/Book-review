## About Project

So in this one we are about to build a books review portal.
You will see a list of books and every single one will have a rating and how many reviews it has.
You will be able to see what were the most popular books last month. And then what were the highest rated books in the last time, whether that's last six months or just last month.
Now, you will be able to search those books by title, and it's not a JavaScript powered search engine.
And you are able to add the review ourselves.
